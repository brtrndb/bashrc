# .bashrc
My .bashrc file. Simple & elegant.

### Installation
Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/brtrndb/bashrc.git
```
Then copy the .bashrc file to your home directory.
```
cp .bashrc ~/
```

### Aliases
- Aliases to correct typos in commands. For example `sl` instead of `ls`.
- Aliases for lazy people. For example `e` instead of `emacs`.

### Prompt
- Display classical informations like time, user and host.
- Display the current directory shortened if it is too long in the terminal.
- Display the current git branch, changes and number of commits unpushed.

### Note
Based on Ubuntu 15.10 default .bashrc.
