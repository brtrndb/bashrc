# .bashrc
My .bashrc files. Simple & elegant.

### Installation
Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/brtrndb/bashrc.git
```
Then run the `install.sh` script.
```
install.sh -i
```
The `-i` option is to only update the `.bashrc` file. Without, it will only copy the files into `.bashrc.d`.

### Aliases
- Aliases to correct typos in commands. For example `sl` instead of `ls`.
- Aliases for lazy people, like `e` instead of `emacs`.

### Git
Some aliases for git.

### Prompt
- Display classical informations like time, user and host.
- Display the current directory shortened if it is too long in the terminal.
- Display the current git branch, changes and number of commits unpushed.
