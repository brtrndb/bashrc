# .bashrc
My .bashrc files. Simple & elegant.

### Installation
Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/brtrndb/bashrc.git
```
Then run the `install.sh` script.
```
install.sh
```
The `-u` option is to only update the files in `.bashrc.d`.

### Aliases

- Aliases for lazy people. For example `e` instead of `emacs`.

### Git
Some aliases for git.

### Prompt
- Display classical informations like time, user and host.
